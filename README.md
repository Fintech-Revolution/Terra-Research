Terra's developing language is Rust, the Smart Contracts are called CosmWasm Smart Contracts. They have their own Academy to get you started into developing on Terra more modules coming soon, like libraries, deploy and testing. Terra Software Development Kit (SDK) in Python and the Terra.js are  simple libraries for building software that can interact with the Terra blockchain and provides simple abstractions over core data structures, serialization, key management, and API request generation.
